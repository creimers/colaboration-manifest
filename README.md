# colaboration manifest

When working together, we declare to try our very best in adhering to the following points:

1. always work on a feature branch
2. commit early, commit often
3. feature branches and commits are prefixed with the issue number (e.g. `feature/#21-red-button`)
4. all pending commits are pushed to remote at the end of the day
5. all pull requests need >= 1 review
6. hour sheets and invoices are submitted during the first week of the following month
